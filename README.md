# Quackle

Fully functional twitter-like app with React frontend, NodeJS backend and MongoDB database. Requires a secure login using JSON Web Tokens, which is used to validate all secure API calls.

Users can follow each other, and create “Quacks” which can be liked, as well as tag up to 6 other users, which will be displayed in that user’s “pond”.

Users can customise their profiles to their liking.

Hosted using Vercel and MongoDB Atlas
